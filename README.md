# ASIC-Implementation-of-Motion-Estimator-in-14nm-CMOS
Physical Design

## Project Concept and Abstract:

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a motion estimator for video compression using the Block Matching Algorithm (BMA), which effectively identifies motion between successive video frames. The development begins with a Hardware Description Language (HDL) model and proceeds through the full digital design flow, culminating in a GDSII layout suitable for fabrication. The design will be implemented using 14nm CMOS technology to ensure a compact, high-performance, and power-efficient solution, making it well-suited for modern video processing and compression applications.

The objective of this project is the RTL2GDSII implementation of the Motion Estimator design, used to reduce data size while maintaining video quality in video compression, in cutting-edge 14nm FinFET technology.

## Verification Plan:

A comprehensive set of testbenches will be developed to validate the functionality of the motion estimator design. These testbenches will include both deterministic inputs with known motion vectors and randomized stimuli to ensure robust verification. The outputs generated by the design under test (DUT) will be compared against expected results derived from a verified reference model or calculated manually. This comparison will help identify any discrepancies and confirm the correctness and reliability of the design across a wide range of input scenarios.

## Design Plan:

### 1. RTL Verification:
The Register Transfer Level (RTL) code will be thoroughly verified to ensure it functions as intended and meets all design specifications before advancing to the synthesis stage.
### 2. ASIC Front-End Flow (Synthesis):
The verified RTL will be synthesized into a gate-level netlist. During this stage, initial timing analysis will be performed to ensure the design can meet the desired clock frequency.
### 3. ASIC Back-End Flow (Physical Design):
Physical implementation includes floorplanning, standard cell placement, clock tree synthesis (CTS), and routing. These steps establish the physical layout of the design.
### 4. Parasitic Extraction and Timing Analysis:
Parasitic elements (resistance and capacitance) will be extracted from the routed layout. Static Timing Analysis (STA) using tools like PrimeTime will be conducted to ensure the design meets timing constraints under post-layout conditions.
### 5. Power and Area Optimization:
The final design will be optimized for power efficiency and area reduction, ensuring it meets performance, timing, and manufacturability goals within the constraints of the 14nm CMOS process.
